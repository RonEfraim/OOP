Program:
This program we make simple objects of geometric shapes and draws them on screen.

Our Files:
-Rectangle: Rectangle.h & Rectangle.cpp:
 a rectangle perallel to the board.
-Isosceles Triangle: IsoscelesTriangle.h & IsoscelesTriangle.cpp
 an isosceles triangle that his base is perallel to the board.
-House: House.h & House.cpp:
 a house that is made of the isosceles triangle and the rectangle,
 the house is build that the triangle will go on top of the rectangle
 and triangle's base will not be larger than the rectangle's width.
-Kite: Kite.h & Kite.cpp:
 a kite that is made out of 2 isosceles triangles that will share the
 same base and x cord of top/botton vertex and not necessarily have 
 equal sizes if triangles.

Remarkable Algorithms:
bool "shape" ::scale(double factor);

Known bugs:
none.

Other notes:
none.
